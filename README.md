# Base-Converter
An argument-based mathematical base converter for CTF, written in Python.

### What it does
It converts between any base and any base from 2 to 36 (and 64).

### Compatability
Written in Python 3.8.1, should work in any other version of at least Python 3, I need to check on Python 2. Use the -h or --help commands for actual documentation.
Works on both windows and linux, as long as you have python installed.

### Installation
Literally just put it wherever you want in your file system, and it is ready to go. Just make sure to use the absolute file path if it is not in PATH.

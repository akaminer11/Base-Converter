An argument-based mathematical base converter for CTF, written in Python.

### What it does:
It converts between any base and any base from 2 to 36 (and 64).

### Compatability
Written in Python 3.8.1, should work in any other version of at least Python 3, I need to check on Python 2. Use the -h or --help commands for actual documentation.
